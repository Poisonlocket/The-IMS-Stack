I've written CLI tools in Bash, Python, and even Node.js—but nothing has come close to the speed, simplicity, and satisfaction I get from using Go. Here's why.

### Compile Once, Run Anywhere

Go produces a single static binary. No runtime. No dependencies. I can send a binary to a coworker or drop it into a Docker container without worrying about what’s installed on the machine.

### Easy Concurrency

Need to parse multiple files at once? Download a bunch of APIs in parallel? Go's goroutines and channels make this kind of work ridiculously simple and clean.

### Standard Library is a Dream

Want to build a mini HTTP server? Parse JSON? Handle file paths across OSes? The standard library has your back—and it's actually pleasant to use.

### Conclusion

If you're into building small tools that punch way above their weight, I highly recommend giving Go a shot. Once you get a taste for how quick the compile-run cycle is, you'll be hooked.
