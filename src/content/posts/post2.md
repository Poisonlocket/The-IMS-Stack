We all start with Bash. Some stay. Some move on. For me, discovering the Fish shell felt like unlocking a productivity boost I didn’t know I needed.

### Autocompletion That Feels Like Magic

Fish suggests past commands as you type—intuitively and visually. It even shows you completions from Git branches, previous history, and man pages. It’s like your terminal is finally listening to you.

### Sane Defaults

No need to configure obscure dotfiles or install 10 plugins. Fish works beautifully out of the box. Syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, and a cleaner scripting syntax all come standard.

### Beautiful Scripting

Fish scripts are more readable than Bash or Zsh equivalents. No more `[[ $FOO == bar ]]` madness. It feels like modern shell scripting should.

### Final Verdict

I didn’t expect switching shells to be such a game changer. But here we are—typing less, moving faster, and never looking back at Bash again.
